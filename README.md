# NYC Public Schools SAT Performance Analysis

## Overview
This project analyzes SAT performance across New York City public schools to identify top-performing schools, examine score variations across boroughs, and understand the distribution of academic achievement.

## Dataset
The analysis uses `schools.csv` containing SAT scores (math, reading, writing) for NYC public schools across all five boroughs.

## Analysis Highlights

### DataCamp Project Tasks
The following analyses were completed as part of the [DataCamp](https://www.datacamp.com/) Associate Data Scientist in Python track:
- **Best Math Schools**: Identified schools with average math scores ≥ 80% of max (640+)
- **Top 10 SAT Schools**: Ranked schools by total SAT score
- **Borough Variation**: Found Manhattan has the largest standard deviation in SAT scores (230.29)

### Extended Analysis (Self-Directed)
I expanded the project with additional visualizations:
- **Borough Comparison**: Bar chart comparing average SAT scores across all five boroughs
- **Math vs Reading Correlation**: Scatter plot showing strong positive correlation between subjects
- **Score Distribution**: Histogram revealing right-skewed distribution of total SAT scores

## Key Findings
- **Top School**: Stuyvesant High School leads with highest math score (754) and total SAT (2144)
- **Borough Leader**: Staten Island has the highest average SAT score
- **Score Correlation**: Schools strong in math also excel in reading
- **Distribution**: Most schools score 1100-1300, with few elite schools above 1800
